Files created by the Babel transpiler are to be put into this directory (see the [`transpile` task](https://github.com/Amphiluke/open-evolver/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L19) in `gulpfile.js`). Those files are not under version control.

Once you install the project locally via `npm install` this directory will be filled with automatically transpiled files. You may also refresh the contents of this directory manually:

```
npm run transpile
```
